# BookApp

This is an app created using Reactjs. It enables the user to search for books and categorize them
depending on whether he or she has read them, wants to read them, is currently reading them or none
of the above.

## Installing

To get the app running you will need to run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
and then npm start to start the server.


## Using the App

The app starts in the / url (main page) in which the selected books will appear categorized by
currently reading, read, or want to be read on three shelves. In each book there is a green button
which opens a drop down menu enabling the user to change shelves or dismiss the book by clicking none,
if none is selected the user can press the button in the bottom right corner to search for it and with
the same way bring it back to a shelf of his or hers choice.
